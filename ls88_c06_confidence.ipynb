In this example, we would like to determine whether or not there is an actual difference between the average number of cats owned by men and women. In order to come up with a conclusion, we will need these important pieces (taken from the Fall 2015 Data 8 Course):\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Null Hypothesis</b>: This says that the data were generated at random under clearly specified assumptions that make it possible to compute chances. The word \"null\" reinforces the idea that if the data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to nothing but chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Alternative Hypothesis</b>: This says that some reason other than chance made the data differ from what was predicted by the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Test Statistic</b>: In order to decide between the two hypothesis, we must choose a statistic upon which we will base our decision. This is called the test statistic. The test statistic can be anything you want it to be as long as it is repeatable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>P-value</b>: The P-value is the probability, under the null hypothesis, that the test statistic is equal to the value that was observed or is even further in the direction of the alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your P-value is under 0.05, the observed test statistic is said to be statistically significant at the 5% level, a conventional level of significance. If your P-value is under 0.01, the observed test statistic is statistically significant at the 1% level. If you obtain a highly significant result, with a very low P-value, you can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  Recall that rejecting a \"null\" hypothesis means you're finding a pattern, typically a good thing!\n",
    "\n",

If our dataset looks like 4 \"boxcars\" (i.e., number 6's), or like a real outlier, then we know something special is happening.
